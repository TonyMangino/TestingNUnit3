RUNNING CATEGORIES FROM TEST EXPLORER

Notes:
1. It may be necessary to rebuild the solution after applying the
Category attribute to an Test in order for it to appear in Test Explorer.

2. A Category attribute can be applied to the Test class, and so, then
applied to all Tests defined in the Test class.

Steps:
1. To only run Tests in a particular Category, apply the [Category()]
attribute to the desired Tests. A Test can have multiple Category attributes
applied to in, which will associate the Test with each individual Category.

2. In Test Explorer, click the <Group By> button from the menu bar.

3. To execute all the Tests in a Category, right-click the Category and select <Run Selected Tests>.
