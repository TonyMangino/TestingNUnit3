RUNNING CATEGORIES FROM THE COMMAND LINE

Notes:
1. To only run Tests in a particular Category, apply the [Category()]
attribute to the desired Tests. A Test can have multiple Category attributes
applied to in,  which will associate the Test with each individual Category.

2. It may be necessary to rebuild the solution after applying the
Category attribute to an Test in order for it to appear in Test Explorer.

3. A Category attribute can be applied to the Test class, and so, then
applied to all Tests defined in the Test class.

Steps:
1. Right-click on the test project in your solution.

2. Click "Open Folder in File Explorer" in the context menu.

3. Hold down the Shift key and right-click on the Windows Explorer window.

4. Click "Open PowerShell window here".

5. To run all Tests under a Category, use the <--filter> attribute.
For example,  <dotnet test NUnit3Tests.csproj --filter "TestCategory=Null test">
will run all Tests under the "Null test" category.
