The constraint-based Assert model uses a single method of the Assert class for all assertions. The logic 
necessary to carry out each assertion is embedded in the constraint object passed as the second parameter 
to that method. The second argument in this assertion uses one of NUnit's syntax helpers to create an EqualConstraint.
